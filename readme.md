# WordPress Type Definitions

This package provides TypeScript definitions of WordPress core PHP objects, such as `WP_Error`, `WP_Post`, and `WP_User`.

## Why on earth would I want this?

If you're writing TypeScript and you're working with a JSON representation of a PHP object from WordPress, it's useful to have a definition for it.

## What about JavaScript objects in WordPress?

This package *might* be extended in the future to provide definitions for JavaScript entities used in WordPress core, but it's not a priority.

## Installation

	npm install wp-types --save-dev
